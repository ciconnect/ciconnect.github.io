CI-Connect are now proud partners with customer wifi solution Purple WiFi! But
what is it? Purple Wifi allows your customers to use your internet connection
‘wirelessly’ and for no monetary fee. In order to access your wireless
connection, they must sign-in via their chosen social network website such as
Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, or by completing a form. In doing so you’re able
to capture details of your customers and with their permission, promote your
business to all their online friends. Find out more on their [website][1].
